t him through the head
and rode away; the mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard
shot three dead, and then got shot dead himself by the other four, "in
consequence of the failure of his ammunition:" after which the mail
was robbed in peace; that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of
London, was made to stand and deliver on Turnham Green, by one
highwayman, who despoiled the illustrious creature in sight of all his
retinue; prisoners in London gaols fought battles with their
turkeys, and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among them,
loaded with rounds of shot and ball; thieves snipped off diamond
crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court drawing-rooms;
musketeers went into St. Giles's, to search for contraband goods,
and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the musketeers fir on the
mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences much out of the
common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy and ever
worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing up
long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on
Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the
hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of
Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer,
and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer's boy
of sixpence.

  All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and
close upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and
seventy-five. Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer
worked unheeded, those two of the large jaws, and those other two of
the plain and the fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their
divine rights with a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven
hundred and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of
small creatures- the creatures of this chronicle among the rest- along
the roads that lay before them.
