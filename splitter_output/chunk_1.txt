  France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than
her sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness
down hill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of
her Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such
humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off,
his tongue torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because
he had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession

France and Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was
put to death, already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be
sawn into boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack

  In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection
to justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and
highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night;
families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without
removing their furniture to upholsterers' warehouses for security; the
highwayman in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being
recognised and challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in
his character of "the Captain," gallantly sho
